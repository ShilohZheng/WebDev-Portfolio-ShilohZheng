      <h2>Basic Introduction of UN Global Goal 15</h2>
      <p>It is to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.</p>

      <h3>Why This Goal Matters</h3>
      <p>Goal 15 is critical because biodiversity sustains all life — including ours. A flourishing life on land is the foundation for our life on this planet. We are all part of the planet's ecosystem and we have caused severe damage to it through deforestation, loss of natural habitats and land degradation. Promoting a sustainable use of our ecosystems and preserving biodiversity is not a cause. It is the key to our own survival.</p>
      
      <h2>Reason Why I Focus on This Goal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Connection:</strong> As I grew up with the accompany of different kinds of animals made me appreciate biodiversity early on.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming Insights:</strong> Stardew Valley and Township taught me sustainable farming and ecosystem balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel Observations:</strong> Seeing different landscapes showed me how communities' happiness rely on healthy ecosystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Impact:</strong> My participation in feeding and vaccinating the stray cats in my neighborhood proved small actions can protect wildlife.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Awareness:</strong> Learning about deforestation and habitat loss from news and in school made me realize urgent action is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Future Responsibility:</strong> I hope the future generations to have a even better environment growing up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What's Happening Around the World?</h3>
      <p>Every year, millions of hectares of forests are lost. This affects not just trees, but also animals like tigers, elephants, and birds who lose their homes. Desertification also turns healthy land into dry, unusable areas, especially in poor countries. When land is damaged, it's hard for people to grow food and have clean water.</p>

      <h3>Why It Should Matter to Teens</h3>
      <p>Even though we're young, we can make a difference. Nature is part of our future — we rely on it for clean air, water, and even fun things like hiking or watching animals. If we don’t take action, future generations won’t have the same beautiful Earth to enjoy.</p>

      <h2>Simple Actions We Can Take</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant trees in your community or school.</li>
        <li>Learn about endangered animals and share info with friends.</li>
        <li>Recycle paper, glass, plastic, metal and old electronics to reduce deforestation and pollution.</li>
        <li>Buy products that are eco-friendly or sustainably made, not tested on animals!</li>
        <li>Support local farms and avoid products made through land damage, don’t use pesticides!</li>
        <li>Donate some extra pocket money to a Goal 15 charity you want to support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>My Dream Future Inspired by Goal 15</h3>
      <p>In the future, I hope to live in a place full of trees, flowers, and animals — just like in Stardew Valley. I imagine running a small farm where animals are safe and forests are protected. It’s peaceful, beautiful, and sustainable.</p>
