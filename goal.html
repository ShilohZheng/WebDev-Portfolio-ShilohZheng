      <h2>Why This Goal Matters</h2>
      <p>Goal 15 is critical because biodiversity sustains all life—including ours. As an animal lover, I've seen how habitat destruction harms species like the dogs I adore. Without forests and healthy land, even human life is at risk.</p>
      
      <h2>How I Connect With This Goal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Through my love for animals and nature</li>
        <li>By playing games like Stardew Valley that teach ecosystem protection</li>
        <li>Through responsible travel practices</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Happening Around the World?</h2>
      <p>Every year, millions of hectares of forests are lost. This affects not just trees, but also animals like tigers, elephants, and birds who lose their homes. Desertification also turns healthy land into dry, unusable areas, especially in poor countries. When land is damaged, it's hard for people to grow food and have clean water.</p>

      <h2>Why It Should Matter to Teens</h2>
      <p>Even though we’re young, we can make a difference. Nature is part of our future—we rely on it for clean air, water, and even fun things like hiking or watching animals. If we don’t take action, future generations won’t have the same beautiful Earth to enjoy.</p>

      <h2>Simple Actions We Can Take</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant trees in your community or school</li>
        <li>Learn about endangered animals and share info with friends</li>
        <li>Recycle paper to reduce deforestation</li>
        <li>Buy products that are eco-friendly or sustainably made</li>
        <li>Support local farms and avoid products made through land damage</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Dream Future Inspired by Goal 15</h2>
      <p>In the future, I hope to live in a place full of trees, flowers, and animals—just like in my favorite games like Township or Stardew Valley. I imagine running a small farm where animals are safe and forests are protected. It’s peaceful, beautiful, and sustainable.</p>
