      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a high school sophomore who just started learning web development. Though my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is still basic, I'm having a lot of passion towards this project currently, this is one of the major project I've done in the whole year of G11. This portfolio project has taught me so much, I cherish this first and probably the last time of building a website of my own!

      <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
      <p>
        This site is part of my Web Development class project. I built it completely from scratch. I created it to showcase my learning progress, share my thoughts on important global issues like wildlife protection, and explore creative design. I want to keep improving and maybe inspire some of my peers to try coding too! Anyways, I can show off to my friends of this website!
