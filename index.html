      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a high school sophomore who just started learning web development. Though my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is still basic, I'm deeply passionate about it. This portfolio project has taught me so much, and I'm fully engaged in exploring this field!

      <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
      <p>
        This site is part of my Web Development class project. I created it to showcase my learning progress, share my thoughts on important global issues like wildlife protection, and explore creative design. I want to keep improving and maybe inspire other students to try coding too!
