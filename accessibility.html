      <h2>Implemented Accessibility Features</h2>
      <p>I designed this website with accessibility in mind, following beginner-level WCAG guidelines to help all possible users have a better experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Semantic HTML5 tags</strong>: In my website, features like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; help screen readers understand page structure.
          <br><em>// Code Source: HTML — Helps assistive tech users know what each section means.</em>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Color contrast</strong>: The color choices of light backgrounds and deep text colors meet the basic readability standards.
          <br><em>// Code Source: CSS — Improves visibility for users with low vision or color blindness.</em>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Keyboard-navigable buttons and links</strong>: All interactive elements like nav links and buttons can be used with just a keyboard, as me myself is using Mac without a mouse.
          <br><em>// Code Source: HTML & CSS — Makes site usable for people with motor impairments.</em>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Readable fonts</strong>: I use Times New Roman for clarity and formality, and adjust the text sizes for easy reading.
          <br><em>// Code Source: CSS — Supports users with visual or cognitive disabilities.</em>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Responsive design</strong>: The layout of my website adapts to different screen sizes for better mobile accessibility.
          <br><em>// Code Source: CSS (media queries) — Ensures access on phones, tablets, and desktops.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>All images used in this project include descriptive <code>alt</code> text so screen reader users can understand the content even without visuals.
        <br><em>// Code Source: HTML — Enables blind or low-vision users to access image meaning.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>My Goal</h3>
      <p>Accessibility matters because everyone deserves to access information equally. This project helped me understand how even small changes can make a big difference.</p>
