      <h2>Animal Protection</h2>
      <p>
        I adore dogs and care deeply about animal welfare. I help to purchase food for the stray cats in my neighborhood. Along with a few neighbors, we've vaccinated almost all stray cats in our neighborhood over the past 2-3 year, ensuring their safety and our peace. It's a small effort that brings me lots of joy, and it aligns perfectly with UN Goal 15.5's call to protect biodiversity — even at the small and local level.

      <h2>Sustainable Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        I seldom play games, but my favorites are Stardew Valley and Township. These two games actually teach me about sustainable living. In Stardew Valley, I mimick crop planting and harvesting, fish when there is overpopulation of fishes — just like UN Goal 15's focus on sustainable land use. Township shows me how to balance urban development with farmland preservation. Through gaming, I've learned that protecting ecosystems (Goal 15.1) isn't just policy — it's daily choices about how we use our resources.

      <h2>Travel & Nature</h2>
      <p>
        I love travelling to foreign countries and observing different landscapes and cultures. Through my travels to over 10 countries, I've seen how closely human life connects with nature — from mountain villages to coastal towns. This aligns with UN Goal 15's focus on protecting terrestrial ecosystems, as I've witnessed firsthand how local communities depend on and care for their natural environments.
