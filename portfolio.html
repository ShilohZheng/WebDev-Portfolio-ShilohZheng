  <p>
    I seldom play games, but one of my favorites is Stardew Valley. This game actually teaches me about sustainable living. I mimic crop planting and harvesting, fish when there is overpopulation — just like UN Goal 15's focus on sustainable land use. Through gaming, I've learned that protecting ecosystems (Goal 15.1) isn't just policy — it's daily choices about how we use our resources.

  <p>
    Another game I enjoy is Township. It shows me how to balance urban development with farmland preservation. Township teaches how careful planning supports sustainable growth, similar to UN Goal 15’s focus on protecting land ecosystems. It’s amazing that such simple games can make big ideas feel real and fun to learn. I really enjoy such kinds of games where I can harvest crops, feed livestocks, manage a city or twon on my own.

    <h2>Travel & Nature</h2>
    <p>
      I love travelling to foreign countries and observing different landscapes and cultures. Through my travels to over 10 countries, I've seen how closely human life connects with nature — from mountain villages to coastal towns. This aligns with UN Goal 15's focus on protecting terrestrial ecosystems, as I've witnessed firsthand how local communities depend on and care for their natural environments.
