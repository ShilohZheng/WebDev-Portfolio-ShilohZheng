      <h2>Animal Protection</h2>
      <p>I adore dogs and care deeply about animal welfare. I help manage a small TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) program in my area to humanely control the local stray cat population. By working with a few neighbors, we’ve fixed and vaccinated 12 cats over the past year, reducing fights and noise. It’s a small effort, but it aligns with UN Goal 15.5’s call to protect biodiversity—even at the local level.</p>

      <h2>Sustainable Gaming</h2>
      <p>My favorite games are Stardew Valley and Township. In these games, I can now understand the UN Goal 15's principles, nature is critical to our survival: nature provides us with our oxygen, regulates our weather patterns, pollinates our crops, produces our food, feed and fibre.</p>
