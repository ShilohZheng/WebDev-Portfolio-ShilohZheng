      <h2>Applying the Design Thinking Process</h2>
      <p>To create a meaningful and user-friendly personal website, I followed the five stages of the Design Thinking process. My goal was to design a clean and beautiful space that showcases who I am and what I care about — especially my connection to the UN Global Goal 15: Life on Land.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Empathize:</strong> I imagined how students and teachers might explore my site. I wanted them to feel that my website is clean and neat. I hope they can be interested, and able to learn about my values and personality with ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Define:</strong> I identified my key goals: the website should reflect my interests (like travel and nature), explain my connection to Goal 15, and be visually appealing but simple to navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ideate:</strong> I brainstormed layout ideas and jot down some ideas for how each section could look. I chose soft colors and clear fonts which is how I usually prefer when look at others' designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prototype:</strong> I built a draft of each page using HTML and CSS, tested different background shades, font sizes, and made sure the layout worked well across all devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Test:</strong> I reviewed the site on my own and asked my friends for feedback. Based on their advice, I adjusted spacing, improved the font sizes, and made the colors more consistent.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Color Choices</h2>
      <p>I chose a warm-cool Morandi color palette with soft blues, purples, oranges, greens, and yellows to give a peaceful and elegant feeling. These tones also reflect nature and balance, which connect to my love for wildlife and the environment.</p>
      <div class="color-swatch">
        <div style="background-color: #B3E5FC; padding: 1rem;">Light Blue</div>
        <div style="background-color: #E1BEE7; padding: 1rem;">Light Purple</div>
        <div style="background-color: #C8E6C9; padding: 1rem;">Light Green</div>
        <div style="background-color: #FFE0B2; padding: 1rem;">Light Orange</div>
        <div style="background-color: #FFF9C4; padding: 1rem;">Light Yellow</div>
      </div>

      <h2>Layout and Typography</h2>
      <p>My layout focuses on clarity. Each page includes clear headings, soft spacing, and readable Times New Roman text. The layout is consistent across all pages, with a navigation bar, header, and footer. I reduced body text size slightly to keep everything neat and minimalist.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Overall Design Goal</h2>
      <p>My design motto is "simple and beautiful." I avoided clutter, used soft color blocks for visual interest, and let the content speak for itself. Every design choice connects back to who I am and what I want to share — especially my appreciation for nature and mindful living.</p>
