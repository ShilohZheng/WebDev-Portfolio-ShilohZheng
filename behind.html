      <h2>Code Screenshots</h2>
      <p>I learned how to build my website by looking at simple portfolio sites made by other students and also checking out the UN Global Goals website. I paid attention to how they organized their pages, used colors, and kept things easy to read. These examples gave me ideas for my own layout and design.</p>

      <h2>Challenging Parts</h2>
      <p>One of the hardest parts was using only one CSS file for the whole website. I had to use <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> to style each page differently while keeping the layout the same. It was also tricky to make sure all the links and styles worked on every page. In JavaScript, I struggled with making buttons work correctly. At first, my code didn’t do anything, but after using <code>console.log()</code> to test it, I fixed the mistakes.</p>

      <h2>Using Developer Tools</h2>
      <p>I used the browser Inspect tool (right-click &gt; Inspect) to check my code and see how the page looked in real time. This helped me fix problems with spacing and layout. I also used it to test changes to colors or fonts before editing my CSS file in VS Code.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>I learned how to use folders to keep my stuff organized, like putting all my images in one place and linking my CSS file to each html file properly. I also learned how to use JavaScript to add simple actions, like changing text or colors when clicking a button. Using <code>getElementById</code> and <code>addEventListener</code> was new to me, but it was fun to see it work!</p>

      <h2>Written Reflection</h2>
      <p>
      Creating this website was a big learning experience for me. Before this project, I didn’t know how to build a full website from scratch, but now I understand how HTML and CSS work together to create structure and design. I followed what I learned from the VS Code Edu Intro to Web Dev course. It showed me how to use tags like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and how to connect them with CSS using class and id selectors.<br><br>
    
      One of the biggest challenges I had was getting all my pages to work using only one CSS file. At first, I wanted each page to look a bit different, but I also didn’t want to make my life so complicated. I had to think carefully about how to use IDs for each page’s <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag and write specific styles in my CSS using <code>#pageID</code> to make small changes while still sharing most of the same layout and fonts. It was confusing at first, but after testing and organizing my code, I figured out a system that worked.<br><br>
    
      Another big challenge was placing different types of images on my pages. Some needed to be centered, some needed to show side by side, and some pictures need to be grouped together with only one explanation below. I had to learn how to use <code>flex</code> and <code>max-width</code> in CSS to control how the images were displayed. It took a lot of trial and error to make the layouts look balanced and responsive, especially when I used multiple images in one row or when I added captions.<br><br>
    
      I also had some issues with font sizes. Sometimes the text looked too big or too small on different pages, and I didn’t know why. I learned how to fix it by setting base font sizes in the <code>body</code> and using <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> units in CSS. I also learned to use margins and padding to make the text look neat and easy to read. I had to go back many times and adjust things so everything would be balanced and clean.<br><br>
    
      My navigation bar was causing me a lot of trouble at first. It was stacking vertically instead of showing the links in a row. I tried a lot of times on how to fix it, and finally used <code>display: inline-block</code> or <code>flex</code> to make it horizontal. I tested both and chose the one that worked best for my layout. Once the navbar looked good, I copied it to all my pages so everything stayed consistent.<br><br>
    
      Overall, I learned that building a website is not just about writing code, but also about testing, fixing, and thinking about the user experience. I feel more confident now when I use HTML and CSS. I understand how to write clean code, organize folders, and make a site that works across multiple pages. I’m proud of the final result, as I never thought I could really create a website on my own, and I know this is just the beginning of what I can create.
